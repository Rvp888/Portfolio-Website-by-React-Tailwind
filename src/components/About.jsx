          I have been coding from last one year and have a good understanding of
          the latest web development technologies and trends. I am well-versed
          in using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I am also proficient in React.Js.
          I have a good understanding of how to create responsive and
          user-friendly webpages that are both visually appealing and easy to
          use.

          I am a self-motivated professional with a strong attention to detail,
          and I am capable of meeting deadlines while delivering high quality
          results. I am passionate about web development and always looking for
          new ways to improve my skills and knowledge. I am currently looking
          for an entry level Web Developer role.
